# User Interface design practise

Recently I noticed a job in `Indeed`, and this company is hiring a junior web developer. They are asking to sytle upt the job advertisement to show what you got. However, I got no luck to apply the job, because they closed the job recruitement 1 day after I saw it.  
However, this is a really good experience for me to learn how to design `user interface`. I am happy to show what I've done.

## Adobe XD
I used `Adobe XD` to draw down my idea. Some people will argue `sketch`, but they don't know I don't have mac-book. I will like to get one when I am employed  as a web developer:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.  

## my outcome
This is my outcome, I've done it by pure `scss` + `html`.
